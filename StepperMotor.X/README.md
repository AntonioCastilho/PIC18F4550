## 

This software controls a linear displacement stepper motor through the PORTB PIC18F4550 that drives a power stage, composed of four IRFZ44N N-channel MOSFET transistors.

The stepper motor used is the same used in the Nissan CVT automatic transmission to change gears, controlling the proportional pressure of the pulleys.
