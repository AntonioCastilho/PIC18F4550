# Basic programs for PIC
Study and elaboration of basic codes for use in the project Briguela.

### LCD Display and ADC module
Example of validation in a simple system, of the codes for the LCD Display interface and ADC module. The objective is to show on the LCD the voltage between 0 and 5V, obtained in a voltage divider with a potentiometer and read on channel 0 of the ADC module.
Voltage is obtained with precision of 2 digits after the decimal point, without using float variables.
