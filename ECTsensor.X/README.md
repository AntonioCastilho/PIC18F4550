## This program uses an NTC thermistor to obtain the temperature.

It is for automotive application in liquid environment, normally for engine cooling system control.
The Beta Formula was used to calculate the temperature, from a known temperature measurement and its resistance, corrected with the Beta coefficient.
There is a little explanation in the program description.

Thanks to Iguaçu Componentes Eletrônicos (www.iguacu.com.br), for the information about the characteristics of the NTC thermistor.
